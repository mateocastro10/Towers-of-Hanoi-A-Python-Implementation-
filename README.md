# Hanoi Tower
 The code provides a complete implementation of the Towers of Hanoi game with an interactive graphical interface. The Pila class is used as an abstract data structure to represent the stacks of disks. Users can input the number of disks and watch the game being solved step by step. The graphical interface dynamically updates to show the current state of the stacks and disks.
